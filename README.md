# AS3DR
AS3DR is a 3D stratigraphic modeling method, which belongs to multiple-point geostatistics (MPS).Here we provide the code and the dataset.

The AS3DR_simulation.rar is the C# code.
The fold_TI.sgems is a 2D training image with the size of 100x100x1, see the file fig_5.tif.
The 1_TI.sgems and the 150_TI.sgems is two 2D training images with the size of 200x150x1 in a 3D grid with the size of 200x150x100, see the file fig_7.tif.
The small_sections_guangdong.rar is four 2D training images in the Foshan city 3D grid with the size of 318x169x143,see the file fig_15.tif.
