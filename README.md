# AS3DR
AS3DR is a 3D stratigraphic modeling method, which belongs to multiple-point geostatistics (MPS).Here we provide the code and the dataset.

The AS3DR_simulation.rar is the C# code.
The fold_TI.sgems is a 2D training image with the size of 100x100x1, see the file fig_7.tif.
the 1_TI.sgems and the 150_TI.sgems is two training image with the size of 200x150x1 in a 3D grid with the size of 200*150*100, see the file fig_1.tif.
